## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my blog!

Let's start by saying hello to the world using my favorite programming language:

<CodeBlock
  className='my-24'
  compact
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code: 'console.log("Hello, World!")',
      label: "JavaScript",
      language: "js",
    },
  ]}
  copyButton
/>

My name is Jonash (w3nash), and I am currently a student at Gordon College, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. As a student software engineer and researcher, I have developed a deep passion for computer science, and I am excited to share my journey with you through this blogging.

## My Goals

One of my current goals is to start writing blogs and build a portfolio that showcases my work and interests. Through this blog, I aim to document my learning experiences, share insights from my research and current trends, and provide valuable resources for fellow computer science enthusiasts.

## What To Expect

In this blog, you can expect to find a variety of content, including coding tutorials, research and current trends insights, and project showcases. My goal is to create a space where we can learn and grow together as a community. I encourage you to engage with the content, share your thoughts, and connect with me through social media.

## Wrapping Up

Let's end this post with a quote that inspires me:

> _"The only way to do great work is to love what you do."_ - **Steve Jobs**

Thank you for visiting my blog! I am excited to embark on this journey with you and look forward to sharing my experiences and knowledge. Stay tuned for upcoming posts, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
